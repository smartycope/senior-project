1. Followed this link: https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/installing-tensorflow-with-gpu-acceleration-on-linux-f3f55dd15a9
2. Used python3.11, cuDNN==8.8, CUDA==11.8, tensorflow==2.14
3. Used this table for versions: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#gpu
4. my gpu specs, my computer specs, my os specs
5. Used miniconda
5.5. Had to install nvidia-drivers (the package on the tutorial, double check) 550, and then had to restart (not in tutorial), but according to this page: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html, anything >=520.61.05 should work (I ended up installing 525 as well, along the way)
6. couldn't find cuDNN==8.7 (doesn't exist on conda for some reason) or CUDA==12.* (not released on conda yet), so had to downgrade python version and fudge some package versions, which worked out
7. Used https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68614547/tensorflow-libdevice-not-found-why-is-it-not-found-in-the-searched-path to find what to put for `export XLA_FLAGS=--xla_gpu_cuda_data_dir=/usr/lib/cuda`
8. Had to sudo apt install cuda-toolkit on computer, not mentioned in tutorial
9. benchmarks:
Time taken for GPU: 17.93414807319641
Time taken for CPU: 219.7570071220398
12.253551505492416x speedup!
